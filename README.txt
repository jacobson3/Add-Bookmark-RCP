Right-click pugin built in LabVIEW 2016

When a user right clicks an object it should add a menu option to Add Tag. This menu should have a submenu item for each tag found in the active project. When the user selects a tag to add it should either add the tag to the beginning of the text, or create a new text label and attach it to the object.
